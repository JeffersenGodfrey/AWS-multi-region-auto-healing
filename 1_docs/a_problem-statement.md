# Problem Statement

Modern cloud applications require high availability and resilience.
Manual monitoring and recovery increase downtime and operational risk.

This project addresses:
- Automatic detection of failures
- Self-healing infrastructure
- Region-level failover
- Minimal manual intervention

The goal is to design a reliable, production-style cloud system using AWS managed services.
