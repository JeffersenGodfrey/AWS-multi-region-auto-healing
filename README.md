# AWS Multi-Region Auto-Healing Cloud Platform

## Overview
This project demonstrates a production-style AWS cloud architecture designed for high availability, fault tolerance, and automatic recovery.

The system detects infrastructure and application failures and recovers automatically without manual intervention.

## Objectives
- Design an auto-healing AWS architecture
- Implement monitoring and automated recovery
- Build a multi-region failover strategy
- Use cloud-native, serverless components where possible

## Core AWS Services
- Amazon EC2 & Auto Scaling Group
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Amazon CloudWatch & SNS
- AWS Lambda
- AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
- Amazon Route 53
- Amazon DynamoDB (Global Tables)

## Documentation
📄 Detailed explanation, implementation steps, and proof screenshots are available in:
`docs/Project_Report.pdf`

> Note: Infrastructure is created only for testing and is destroyed after validation to optimize cost.
